1. Convert the following into code that uses a while loop.

<tt>print 2
    prints 4
    prints 6
    prints 8
    prints 10
    prints Goodbye!</tt>

        2. Convert the following into code that uses a while loop.

<tt>prints Hello!
prints 10
prints 8
prints 6
prints 4
prints 2</tt>

        3. Write a while loop that sums the values 1 through end, inclusive. end is a variable that we define for you.
        So, for example, if we define end to be 6, your code should print out the result:

        21

        which is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6.
