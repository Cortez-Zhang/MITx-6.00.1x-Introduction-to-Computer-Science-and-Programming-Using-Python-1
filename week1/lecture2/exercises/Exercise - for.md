* Convert the following code into code that uses a for loop.

<code>
    prints 2
    prints 4
    prints 6
    prints 8
    prints 10
    prints "Goodbye!"
</code>


* Convert the following code into code that uses a for loop.

<code>
prints "Hello!"
prints 10
prints 8
prints 6
prints 4
prints 2
</code>


* Write a for loop that sums the values 1 through end, inclusive. end is a variable that we define for you. So, for example, if we define end to be 6, your code should print out the result:

<code>21</cpde>

which is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6.
