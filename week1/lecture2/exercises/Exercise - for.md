1. Convert the following code into code that uses a for loop.

<tt>
    prints 2
    prints 4
    prints 6
    prints 8
    prints 10
    prints "Goodbye!"
</tt>


        2. Convert the following code into code that uses a for loop.

<tt>
prints "Hello!"
prints 10
prints 8
prints 6
prints 4
prints 2
</tt>


        3. Write a for loop that sums the values 1 through end, inclusive. end is a variable that we define for you. So, for example, if we define end to be 6, your code should print out the result:

<tt>
21
</tt>

        which is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6.
